Personal project that I made myself while I was using Angular for the very first time.
This was my first attempt at making something more complicated that the simple html / css that we wrote at school. I didn't have the goal to make it a publicly available app, it was more curiosity-driven / for fun (And I never finished it :) ).
Everything is probably broken now since I remember using questionable ways of fetching my data :p

For those that took a look at my other project / profile, this was not part of my programming course at Technobel, It was my last year at school (yay) and I was just tinkering arround
